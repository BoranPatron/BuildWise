BuildWise - Database Migration Fix
====================================

Problem:
--------
The database migration system had multiple issues:
1. Circular dependencies between migrations
2. Multiple migrations with down_revision = None (treated as initial migrations)
3. Migrations trying to add columns to non-existent tables
4. The "users" table didn't exist, causing migrations to fail

Error:
------
sqlalchemy.exc.ProgrammingError: (psycopg2.errors.UndefinedTable) relation "users" does not exist
[SQL: ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN current_rank_key VARCHAR(50)]

Root Cause:
-----------
- No proper initial migration existed that creates the base tables
- Migrations like "add_gamification_fields_migration.py" tried to alter non-existent tables
- Migration chain was broken with circular references

Solution:
---------
1. Created a single comprehensive initial migration: 00_initial_schema.py
   - This migration creates ALL tables from the current SQLAlchemy models
   - Uses Base.metadata.create_all() to ensure all tables are created
   - Includes proper SSL configuration for PostgreSQL on Render
   - Smart enough to only create missing tables if some already exist

2. Deleted all problematic migrations:
   - add_gamification_fields_migration.py (fields already in model)
   - add_last_daily_deduction.py (field already in model)
   - create_buildwise_fees_tables.py (tables created by initial migration)
   - fix_buildwise_fees_datetime_columns.py (not needed)
   - add_inspection_system.py (tables created by initial migration)
   - add_appointment_details_fields.py (fields already in model)
   - add_appointments_table.py (table created by initial migration)
   - add_construction_phase_columns.py (fields already in model)
   - add_construction_phase_to_cost_positions.py (fields already in model)
   - add_construction_phase_to_milestones.py (fields already in model)
   - add_inspection_extended_fields.py (fields already in model)
   - 670708bfcd4a_merge_multiple_heads.py (no longer needed)

3. Result:
   - Clean migration state with ONE initial migration
   - All tables and columns from current models are created
   - No circular dependencies
   - Fresh databases will work correctly
   - Existing databases will only get missing tables added

Migration Structure:
--------------------
migrations/
  versions/
    00_initial_schema.py  <- ONLY migration file

Next Steps:
-----------
1. Commit and push these changes
2. Redeploy on Render
3. The migration will create all tables from scratch
4. Application should start successfully

Future Migrations:
------------------
When adding new features that require schema changes:
1. Use: alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"
2. Review the generated migration
3. Test locally
4. Commit and deploy

Note: Any future migrations will have down_revision = '00_initial_schema'
